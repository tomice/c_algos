# C Algorithms
Just a random collection of algorithms and whatnot in C. 

## Usage
Most can be compiled with simply running something like:

```bash
gcc -o foo.c foo
```

## Authors and License
I didn't write most of the code. Most of it is easily found on the Internet.
I take no responsibility for any of this code. If you plan on using this,
research it a bit before going with it. There are probably lots of bugs.
